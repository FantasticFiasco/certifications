## Supervised learning

- Categories
  - Regression - Predict results within a continuous output
  - Classification - Predict results in a discrete output
- Model representation
  - `m` - Number of training examples
  - `x` - Input variable (feature)
  - `y` - Output (target)
  - `(x, y)` - One training example
  - `(x^(i), y^(i))` - i:th training example
  - `h` - Algorithm function (hypothesis)
- Gradient descent - Used when minimizing cost functions

### Unsupervised learning

Approach problems with little or no idea what our results should look like.
